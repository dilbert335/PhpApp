# My php app

## Overview

This is a basic PHP website that includes user login functionality and a welcome page. the database is PDO

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- PDO extension installed and enabled
- A database

## Installation

1. **Download the code**


2. **Set up the database**

The default is SQL Lite but you can change it to whatever database you want
  
3. Set up webserver

If you want to have the website so others can see it, you need a webserver. I don't have experience with this, so please do not ask me how.

## Troubleshooting

- **PDO Error:**
- Make sure that PDO is installed
- Make sure that the database is configured correctly
